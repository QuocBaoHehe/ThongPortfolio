  <h2>üôã About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a passionate mechanical engineering student at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona, with a strong foundation in design, analysis, and prototyping.
    My experience spans from hands-on R&D work to robotics competitions and academic research in optical sensing.
  </p>
  <p>
    I enjoy building real-world solutions that blend mechanics and technology, from lifting machines to embedded systems.
    Whether it's simulating stress in SolidWorks or integrating servo motors with Arduino, I take pride in both precision and creativity.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of engineering, I enjoy mentoring others, participating in technical clubs, and constantly exploring new tools and ideas.
